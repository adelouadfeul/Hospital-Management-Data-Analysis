# Hospital Management Data Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes hospital operations, patient outcomes, and staff performance using multiple datasets. The goal is to identify patterns and relationships between staff availability, patient satisfaction, service efficiency, and operational challenges.

## Datasets
All data files are located in the `hospita_mangemant` folder:

1. **patients.csv** – Individual patient information (age, service, satisfaction, arrival/departure dates).  
2. **services_weekly.csv** – Weekly service metrics (admissions, refusals, staff morale, events, bed occupancy).  
3. **staff.csv** – Staff details (roles, assigned services).  
4. **staff_schedule.csv** – Staff attendance records by week.

## Key Analyses
- Staff attendance and its correlation with patient satisfaction.  
- Bed occupancy rates by week and service.  
- Services with the highest patient refusal rates.  
- Impact of special events (e.g., epidemics, strikes) on admissions and morale.  
- Seasonal trends in patient requests.  
- Patient length of stay, satisfaction, and age distributions.  
- Staff-to-patient ratios and role distributions.

## Tools
- Python 3.x  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn

## Usage
1. Clone or download the repository.  
2. Ensure all CSV files are in the `hospita_mangemant` folder.  
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to run analyses and visualizations.
